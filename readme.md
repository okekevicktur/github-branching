Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Use lowercase for HTML tags and attributes
- Use double quotes for attribute values
- Use a single space between HTML tags

File Structure

- Keep all HTML files in the /html directory
- Keep all CSS files in the /css directory
- Keep all images and assets in the /assets directory

Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and concise file names (e.g., header.html, styles.css)
- Use lowercase and hyphens for file names (e.g., footer-section.html)

Code Organization

- Keep related styles together in the CSS file (e.g., all button styles together)
- Use comments to separate sections of code and explain complex logic

Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Use CSS classes instead of IDs for styling
- Test your code in multiple browsers for compatibility

Collaboration

- Commit changes regularly with descriptive commit messages
- Pull changes from the main branch before starting new work
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes
